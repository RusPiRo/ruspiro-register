# RusPiRo Register

The crate provides the definitions to conviniently work with register field values that are typically presented by a set of bit fields.

## Usage

To use this crate simply add the dependency to your ``Cargo.toml`` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
ruspiro-register = "||VERSION||"
```

A single register field is specified with its bit mask and the bit shift. The `RegisterField` structure can be instantiated for the types `u8`, `u16`, `u32` and `u64`.

```rust
use ruspiro_register::*;

fn main() {
    let field = RegisterField::<u32>::new(0x3, 6);
}
```

To represent a specific value of a register field the `RegisterFieldValue` structure is used. It is available for the same scalar types as the `RegisterField`: `u8`, `u16`, `u32` and `u64`.

```rust
use ruspiro_register::*;

fn main() {
    let field = RegisterField::<u8>::new(0x3, 2);
    // the value to the regsiter field will be shifted and masked internally
    // so it will be provided without any shifting
    let value = RegisterFieldValue::<u8>::new(field, 0b10);
    println!("{:?}", value);
}
```

The register field value printed will look like this then:

```text
RegisterFieldValue { field: RegisterField {
    Bits: [3:2]
    Mask: 0b1100
}, value: 2, raw_value: 8 }
```

It is quite unlikely those definitions will be directly used as the represantation of a full register with all its fields. Typically macros will be used to reduce the complexity of the register definitions. Examples can be found in the [ruspiro-mmio-register](https://crates.io/crates/ruspiro-mmio-register) and the [ruspiro-arch-aarch64](https://crates.io/crates/ruspiro-arch-aarch64) crates.
