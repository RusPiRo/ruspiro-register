## :peach: v0.5.0

  This version contains a major refactoring. The whole crate has been split into actually 3 crates in total. The `ruspiro-register` crate continues to contain the definitions of `RegisterType`, `RegisterField` and `RegisterFieldValue` only. Those definitions are highly generic and can be usefull in various other crates that do not require the other functionality originally beeing part of this crate as well.

  > The system register specific functions and API is moved into the `ruspiro-arch-aarch64` crate.
  >
  > The MMIO register specific functions and API is moved into the `ruspiro-mmio-register` crate.

  Both crates utilizes this one for the register type and field definitions.

    - Introduce a proper Travis-CI pipeline setting to support the lifecycle of the crate incl. publishing to crates.io
